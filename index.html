                <h1>My failures of previous year</h1>
                <p><small>People fail at some point. We all do. But this is an important part of life. While the
                        definition of failure is the “lack of success to something such as an enterprise, or deficient
                        in a desirable quality,” it is not always correct. One of the old sayings, “failure is the path
                        to success,” still holds true even in the current world. Failure should not be considered a
                        means to an end or tagged with permanence. It means missing a target, like in a darts game, but
                        it does not prevent you from trying again. Therefore, when you are faced with the task of
                        writing an essay on failure, how do you go about it? Here is a complete guide on how to write
                        the best essay on failure.</small></p>
