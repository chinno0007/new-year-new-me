                <h1>My failures of previous year</h1>
                <p><small>People fail at some point. We all do. But this is an important part of life. While the
                        definition of failure is the “lack of success to something such as an enterprise, or deficient
                        in a desirable quality,” it is not always correct. One of the old sayings, “failure is the path
                        to success,” still holds true even in the current world. Failure should not be considered a
                        means to an end or tagged with permanence. It means missing a target, like in a darts game, but
                        it does not prevent you from trying again. Therefore, when you are faced with the task of
                        writing an essay on failure, how do you go about it? Here is a complete guide on how to write
                        the best essay on failure.</small></p>

                    <h2>Failure is the first step to success</h2>
                    <p>Let's imagine that you have a project in mind that is close to your heart. You have two
                        possibilities: </p>

                    <p>Yourself and try to do it, at the risk of encountering disappointments.</p>

                    <p>Stay where you are and let this project go by, without the risk of failure in accomplishing it.
                    </p>

                    <p>What do you prefer? Asking this question makes you realize that the only way to never fail is to
                        never try. But then, what's better between risking failure by moving forward, and staying in our
                        comfort zone at the risk of regretting it later? It's up to you, the decision is yours.</p>
                    <p>In order to succeed, you must try, and by the same token accept the possibility of failure. And
                        if
                        failure does occur, you must learn to draw the necessary conclusions to recover stronger from
                        it.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="fail-success-2">
                    <h2>Learning from failures to success</h2>
                    <p>It's by putting ourselves into action that we can experience failure. But if this action allows
                        us to
                        learn, to test hypotheses, even if it proves to be unsuccessful, is it still a failure? After
                        all,
                        "practice makes perfect", and it's by failing that one gains experience. </p>
                    <p>By learning from our
                        blunders, we can evolve by identifying our areas for improvement so that we don't repeat the
                        same
                        mistakes over and over again. By doing so, it's even possible to anticipate future obstacles,
                        which
                        makes it possible to prepare as well as possible to face them.</p>
                    <p>Later on, we may encounter new difficulties, but they will be different, and the experience
                        gained
                        will allow us to overcome them more easily. Little by little, we will transform these failures
                        into
                        assets and they will help us grow.</p>
